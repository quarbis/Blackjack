This game was a project for my Codecademy Computer Science Class (https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/computer-science)

I took a break from coding for a while, and I'm also not very experienced, so the coding is quite messy. 
I also completely forgot about classes and objects until it was too late, which I'm sure would've made my code much more cleaner and efficient
